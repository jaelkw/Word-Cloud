Sir Keir tried to use PMQs this lunchtime to score body blows on the PM over key parts of the Government's coronavirus response.

Twitter banned the account Monday for breaking its rules against platform manipulation, spam, and inciting violence.As the United States deals with widespread civil unrest across dozens of cities, "hacktivist" group Anonymous has returned from the shadows. The hacker collective was once a regular fixture in the news, targeting those it accused of injustice with cyber-attacks.

The brief from U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan offers the most detailed explanation for his refusal to immediately sign off on the department's decision to drop its case against Flynn, who pleaded guilty as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. It raises the prospect of a drawn-out clash between two branches of government over whether a judge can be forced to unwind a guilty plea at the Justice Department's behest.Save $50 on the Galaxy Watch Series now and stay fit with Samsung Health fitness programmes.

The Sergeants Benevolent Association tweeted a screenshot of Chiara de Blasio's arrest record and attacked the mayor over his daughter's participation in the protests. Ocasio-Cortez urged the NYPD to de-escalate with protesters rather than respond with violent force, and she told the union to "apologize and own this egregious behavior."America could move weapons stored on British soil if the UK allows Huawei to build its 5G network, a US senator has warned. Tom Cotton, the Republican senator for Arkansas who was called as a witness before the Defence Select Committee, warned that the case for America keeping some US Air Force assets, such as F-35 fighters, in the UK could be weakened if it goes ahead with Huawei, as it would pose a security risk.

Agencies have started turning away from the courses in recent years, after it was discovered the Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile had taken one of Grossman's courses. If you're prepared to kill, Dave Grossman, says, it's "just not that big of a deal."The San Diego Police Department, spurred by the fallout from George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, has immediately banned a controversial restraint technique. At least three major police departments have banned similar neck holds or chokeholds amid increasing attention on policing maneuvers that cut off oxygen to persons under arrest or restraint.

Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy, said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation. The manner of death was ruled homicide, but the office noted that "is not a legal determination of culpability or intent."Chechnya's gay-purging strongman Ramzan Kadyrov has made an unexpected foray into US politics by suggesting Donald Trump might have a thing or two to learn from him about human rights. In a social media post published early on Tuesday morning, the controversial leader demanded American authorities “put an end” to “mayhem” and “illegal actions against citizens.” “Police are lynching people right on the streets of American cities,” he wrote.Offer extended for limited time only.

"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi once called the violent protests in Hong Kong 'a beautiful sight to behold,'" he wrote.The Philippines has told the United States it is suspending its bid to break off a key military pact, the two allies said Tuesday in a sharp turnaround of President Rodrigo Duterte's foreign policy. Duterte in February gave notice to Washington he was axing the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) after accusing the US of interference in his internationally condemned narcotics crackdown. That began a 180-day countdown to ending the deal central to hundreds of joint military exercises with the US per year and a major component of their nearly 70-year-old alliance.On May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after a deli employee called 911, accusing him of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.

The insurgents promptly slammed the report as “baseless and bigoted.” The U.S.-Taliban accord, signed in Qatar's capital of Doha at the end of February, was meant to allow for American troops to gradually leave Afghanistan after 19 years of war and pave way for intra-Afghan negotiations that would shape the country's political future.An Iranian professor who was acquitted in the United States of stealing trade secrets arrived in Iran on Wednesday, Iranian media reported.

Lt. Bob Kroll blamed politicians for the ongoing tension, specifically targeting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The former police chief of Minneapolis called on Kroll to resign, and Frey said Kroll was "shockingly indifferent to his role in undermining that trust and support" of the police force.Let's just say even the best of them should not hang around humans for too long.

This has become a regular theme of Mr Trump's criticism of the WHO, and in his letter to its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 18 May, he renewed this attack saying the WHO "consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal". In response to the criticisms levelled at it, the WHO says it acted properly in accordance with the information it was given by China, sharing it with medical and scientific experts around the world, including from the US.HENRIK MONTGOMERY/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images Sweden is accelerating its review into the success of its coronavirus strategy, which controversially did not involve a lockdown and kept many businesses open.

Remdesivir, which is administered intravenously in hospital, is the first drug to show improvement in COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials and is at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19, which has no approved treatment or vaccine. Earlier this week, Gilead said the drug showed modest benefit in patients with moderate COVID-19 given a five-day course, while those who received it for 10 days in the study did not fare as well.Tropical Storm Cristobal, already the third storm of this year's hurricane season, formed Tuesday afternoon off the coast of Mexico and could reach Texas, Louisiana or the Florida Panhandle by Friday or early next week, meteorologists say. The storm began as a tropical depression with heavy rainfall and flooding over Mexico and Central America.

Accusing it of pandering to China and overlooking an initially secretive response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump said on Friday he was ending Washington's relationship with the WHO. "The United States' contribution and generosity towards global health over many decades has been immense, and it has made a great difference in public health all around the world," he said.Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd. Riot police faced off with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and LA, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse crowds.

The U.S. Army isn't alone in developing weapons that would rely on swarm tactics, as the U.S. Navy has also begun to develop ways that autonomous platforms could engage an enemy with swarming attacks, but now the question is being asked whether drone swarms are actually a type of WMD? Freelance researcher and analyst Zachery Kallenborn, who specializes in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons, CBRN terrorism, drone swarms, and emerging technologies, published a paper “Are Drone Swarms Weapons of Mass Destructions?” that asked that question.Here's why you should not panic.

Tegnell designed a unique strategy by which the country allowed non-essential businesses to remain open, urging citizens to comply with social distancing regulations and to avoid unnecessary travel. Sweden's death rate from coronavirus as of Wednesday sits at 443 per million of the country's population, far higher than its Nordic neighbors Finland (58 per million) and Norway (44 per million), both of which imposed more far-reaching lockdowns of nonessential businesses.Five months have passed since Parris Hopson left her grandparents' house in Massillon, Ohio on Christmas Day in 2019 to go for a walk. “I just don't want to lose hope,” Rochelle said.

The employees affected can stay with the San Francisco-based company if they relocate — Stitch Fix will start hiring for 2,000 positions in lower-cost cities this summer. The company said the layoffs are not related to the pandemic, but the public health crisis has dealt a blow to the retail industry.Here's What You Need To Remember: Korea's development of KF-X will cost more than procuring jets of similar capability abroad, but will come with other benefits: lessening dependence on the United States (vital given chilling Washington-Seoul relations), keeping the profits flowing to domestic business champions, opening foreign export opportunities, and developing a technological base which could develop further high-performance combat aircraft in the future. After nearly two decades in development hell, South Korea appears to be moving forward with plans to build an advanced KF-X Boramae (“Hawk”) domestic jet fighter with a reduced radar cross-section. The Republic of Korea Air Force (ROK) plans to procure 120 KF-Xs to replace the ROK Air Force's aging fleets of 157 F-5E Freedom Fighters and 69 F-4E Phantom jets.British cruise line P&O Cruises, a Carnival subsidiary, is canceling all its sailings until Oct. 15 because of the coronavirus pandemic – after a move by Canada to ban cruises and ferries carrying more than 100 people with overnight capacity in its waters through Oct. 31.

"As a result of the Government of Canada's decision to extend its restriction on cruise ships carrying more than 100 guests until Oct. 31, Royal Caribbean 2020 sailings to Canada, New England and Alaska must be canceled," Royal Caribbean spokesperson Jonathon Fishman confirmed to USA TODAY.In a poll released in May, a representative survey of U.S. adults by the University of Chicago Divinity School and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found two-thirds of Americans don't think that "prohibiting in-person religious services" during the pandemic is a violation of freedom of religion, and that includes a majority of evangelical Christians and Republicans, according to our analysis. When asked about "placing restrictions" on in-person religious services, rather than prohibiting them, 82% of American adults overall think that would not violate religious liberty.A Pakistani girl who was critically injured on the ground last month when a passenger plane went down in a crowded neighborhood of the port city of Karachi has died at a hospital, her relatives and a doctor said Tuesday.

"My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,'' the pope said during his weekly Wednesday audience, held in the presence of bishops due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings. At the same time, the pontiff warned "nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro urged his supporters on Monday to put off their protests against the country's Supreme Court next weekend after counter-demonstrations triggered violent clashes on Sunday.

A protest over the death of a black Frenchman who died in a police operation became a violent one. Adama Traore's death at the age of 24 was four years ago.Donald Trump gave a glimpse into his mindset towards mass protests when he said in 1990 that China showed "power of strength" in a "vicious" crackdown on students in Tiananmen Square. Two decades later, armed riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets cleared protesters away from Lafayette Square before Mr Trump on Monday walked from the White House to St John's Church for a photo-op with a Bible. During the presidential debates in 2016, then-candidate Trump defended his comments on China by calling the Tiananmen Square protests "riots" and that "strong" wasn't an endorsement.Experts fear that a spike in coronavirus cases in West African nations will be devastating for the region. People in countries such as Sierra Leone and Liberia are still traumatized from the Ebola pandemic, which killed 11,000 people in the region over two years. The region is home to some of the poorest countries in the world, and are lacking doctors and vital resources such as ventilators.Here's What You Need To Remember: The UK, France and Germany have all now proclaimed their intent to develop sixth-generation stealth jets and backed that up with initial investments. However, it will likely be a while before we can tell whether the respective governments can sustain the long-term financial outlays, international cooperation, and technically challenging development processes to produce Europe's first stealth jet. With a flourish of a silk curtain at the Farnborough Air Show on July 16, British defense secretary Gavin Williamson unveiled a full-scale model of the Tempest, the UK's concept for a domestically built twin-engine stealth fighter to enter service in the 2030s.Dozens of Android phone owners are reporting on social media that a picture featuring a lake, a cloudy sunset and a green shoreline is crashing their handsets when used as wallpaper.

Anders Tegnell's comments followed mounting criticism of the government's handling of the crisis and a policy that has relied largely on voluntary action, social distancing and common-sense hygiene advice but has failed to prevent the virus spreading. Sweden has a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than European countries such as Britain, Spain and Italy which enforced stringent lockdowns.Russian air strikes have hit Syria's last major rebel bastion for the first time since a March ceasefire came into force, a war monitor said on Wednesday. The Russian strikes on Tuesday evening and at dawn on Wednesday hit an area of the northwest where the boundaries of Hama, Idlib and Latakia provinces meet, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance (HTS), led by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate, and its hardline allies enjoy a significant presence in the area, the Britain-based monitoring group added.As a federal appeals court grappled on Tuesday with a politically charged dispute that long ago faded from the headlines, one of the most urgent and politically polarizing legal fights of the moment seemed to lurk just below the surface. The official topic of Tuesday's arguments before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was Hillary Clinton's bid to avoid giving an in-person deposition to a conservative group about the subject that dogged her during her 2016 presidential bid: her use of a private email account and server during her tenure as secretary of state. Both the Clinton deposition dispute and the Flynn case imbroglio involve an obscure type of legal mechanism that is not currently a household word but may soon be, at least in Washington: mandamus.Patrick van Katwijk/Getty The Netherlands recently acquired a new VIP Boeing Business Jet 737 for its top government officials to use. The Dutch royal family, as well as high-ranking officials such as the prime minister, use the aircraft for state business including traveling overseas for state visits. King Willem-Alexander, as a licensed pilot, frequently flies the aircraft and it was revealed the royal was flying for fun as a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines co-pilot for 21 years.After reaching the Don, German armies would turn south toward the Caucasus oil fields and advance east toward the great industrial city of Stalingrad, on the west bank of the Volga. The capture of Stalingrad, a vital communications center that commanded the land bridge between the Volga and the Don and was a critical transport route between the Caspian Sea and northern Russia, was not part of Hitler's original plan. The advance to the Volga by General Friedrich von Paulus's Sixth Army was meant to provide strategic flank cover for the all-important advance into the Caucasus, where a successful offensive would complete the takeover of the Ukraine, interdict grain supplies from much of the Sov...The global race for a COVID-19 vaccine boils down to some critical questions: How much must the shots rev up someone's immune system to really work? “We are in essence doing a great experiment,” said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, whose lab is testing several vaccine candidates in animals. The animal testing lets scientists see how the body reacts to vaccines in ways studies in people never can, said Kate Broderick, research chief at Inovio Pharmaceuticals.Jeff Remmington, an American professional basketball player trying his hand in China, had already been through xenophobic hell: ostracized in Guangzhou, where he was once celebrated for his acrobatic dunks, denied service at a restaurant with his 4-year-old son because of his skin color, quarantined for two weeks, though he showed no signs of coronavirus infection, he said. “Good evening, fellow neighbors!” read a message that circulated in a neighborhood WeChat group, according to screenshots reviewed by The New York Times. Is money more important than lives?” It continued, “African people are a high-risk group, and Guangzhou people are all not renting to them.Mexican financial regulators said Tuesday they have frozen the bank accounts of 1,939 people and companies believed to be linked to movements of about $1.1 billion in Jalisco drug cartel money. The country's anti-money laundering agency said it worked with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to identify the 1,770 people and 167 companies caught up in the financial dragnet, dubbed "Operation Blue Agave." Blue agave is the cactus-like plant used to make tequila, which is the signature drink of Jalisco, the cartel's home state.Photo by Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via Getty Images Lt. Bob Kroll, President of Minneapolis' police union, said he and a majority of the Minneapolis Police Officers' Federation's board have been involved in police shootings, during an April interview with STIM Radio host Maxwell Thomas Silverhammer reported on by The Intercept. Kroll said he himself has been involved in three, and while many police officers have experienced PTSD after shootings "not one of them has bothered me." These statements were made a mere month before the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after Minneapolis police officers knelt on his neck and pinned him down during an arrest.As demonstrations continue over George Floyd's death, activist Curtis Hayes is challenging protesters to "come up with a better way" and urging everyone to ask why these protests are happening in the first place.

Even if a Pakistani Army offensive into India fails and the Strike Corps counterattacked, tactical nuclear weapons could blunt their spearheads, ideally halting them in their tracks. Of all the countries in the world, just nine are believed to have developed nuclear weapons.Ugandan medical workers say they lack adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for tackling COVID-19 and the risk of infection is making some reluctant to treat patients. The complaints follow revelations on Sunday that seven health workers including two doctors and two nurses had contracted the virus. "The situation is critical, many people are working without PPE," Dr. Mukuzi Muhereza, secretary general for the country's health workers' body, the Uganda Medical Association, told Reuters on Wednesday.France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon. StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus. But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product.A federal judge in Oklahoma has awarded ownership of the zoo made famous in Netflix's “Tiger King” docuseries to Joe Exotic's chief rival.

The letter drew a swift rebuke from a former Minneapolis police chief who called it a disgrace. Lt Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, defended the four officers involved in Floyd's death, including Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes in the lead-up to his death on 25 May. Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges, and the three other officers have been fired.It can take a little while to get to know the ins and outs of a new coffee maker. Each drip coffee maker we test brews roughly 65 cups by the time our engineers are through with it, and brewing is just one of many aspects we evaluate. “In general, for a higher price you can get add-ons like a water filter, clean cycle, clean indicator, permanent filter, or thermal carafe.”HUD Secretary Ben Carson joins Martha MacCallum on 'The Story' to discuss nationwide unrest following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.Governors including one Republican pushed back at President Donald Trump Monday after he told them on a phone call they are "weak" and need to use force to "dominate" riots that have erupted during protests over the death of George Floyd. Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent target of Trump, called the phone call deeply disturbing, adding that instead of offering support or leadership to bring down the temperature at protests, Trump told governors to 'put it down' or we would be 'overridden.SOPA Images/Getty Images Reddit CEO Steve Huffman posted a letter to Reddit employees in response to recent protests over police killings of Black Americans. Former Reddit CEO Ellen K. Pao responded to the letter on Twitter, calling Huffman out for not shutting down pro-Trump subreddit r/the_donald. Reddit quarantined r/the_donald in June 2019, but the subreddit came under fire for being a site for far-right rhetoric.Last week, the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (HSTCSG) took part in the first-of-its-kind major exercise in the Atlantic. From May 28 to May 31, the U.S. Northern Command led a major homeland defense drill, known as Operation Eagle, that was conducted in partnership with North American Aerospace Defense Command, U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Strategic Command and U.S. Space Command. This was the first such large-scale exercise that involved four combatant commands and NORAD.A French court on Wednesday ordered Rwandan genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga be handed over to a United Nations tribunal for trial. U.N. prosecutors accuse Kabuga of bankrolling and arming ethnic Hutu militias that killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda during a 100-day period in 1994. Kabuga, whose arrest in Paris in May ended a manhunt that lasted more than two decades, has called the charges lies.The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it was opening an investigation into whether imports of vanadium, a metal used in aerospace, defense and energy applications, impair U.S. national security. The "Section 232" probe is similar to ones that resulted in broad tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 and a probe underway into imports of titanium sponge. The department said the domestic producers that petitioned the agency, AMG Vanadium and U.S. Vanadium LLC, assert that they are hurt by unfairly priced imports, value added tax regimes in other vanadium-producing countries and "the distortionary effect of Chinese and Russian industrial policies."Sudan on Tuesday swore in a new defense minister more that two months after the death of the former defense chief and amid tensions with neighboring Ethiopia. Maj. Gen. Yassin Ibrahim Yassin was sworn in before Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, head of the ruling sovereign council, according to a statement from the council. Yassin came out of retirement to take the position.In Baltimore, protesters shouted the name of Freddie Gray. In Topeka, Kansas, T-shirts were emblazoned with the name of Dominique White.

Air Force and Northrop Grumman developers recently completed an essential software-empowered process intended to bring greater levels of information processing, data management and new measures of computerized autonomy,  according to published statements from Air Force Acquisition Executive Dr. William Roper. Through virtualization and software-hardware synergy, B-21 sensors, computers, and electronics can better scale, deploy and streamline procedural functions such as checking avionics specifics, measuring altitude and speed and integrating otherwise disparate pools sensor information.The virus triggered closures of unprecedented scale and forced educators across the country to quickly transition to online teaching, many for the first time in their careers. Roughly 11 weeks since the start of the pandemic, 124,000 US schools remain closed for in-person instruction as they limp toward summer break, impacting almost 51 million students. Just as closures have affected the nature of work, they've changed the complexion of teachers' home lives.Bogdan Vechirko, 35, was arrested on suspicion of assault after driving a semi-truck through a George Floyd march in Minneapolis on Sunday.

Footage posted by News12 The Bronx shows Mr Engel asking for the mic, but being denied by Borough president Ruben Diaz.Starbucks Starbucks workers are being asked to decide this week if they want to take an unpaid leave of absence, continue work understanding that hours may be reduced, or quit their jobs. Last week, Starbucks announced a new leave of absence policy, which allows employees to receive benefits while taking up to 120 days of unpaid leave. Rossann Williams, the president of Starbucks' company-operated business in the US and Canada, said the company used employees' feedback to decide "how to best support partners who are not getting the hours they need."Italians were allowed to travel to other regions of the country on Wednesday for the first time in nearly three months, in a further relaxation of lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Travellers boarding trains in Milan, capital of Lombardy in northern Italy, were excited at the prospect of finally being able to visit family and friends elsewhere in the country. "I work here in Milan and up until now I couldn't move between regions," said Anna Falcone, who was getting ready to board a train to Calabria, southwest Italy, to see her parents.Just three months ago, I worked as a librarian at the San Francisco Public Library's Main Branch, where I answered questions on a reference desk. Now, I spend my days calling strangers to ask: Have you had any novel coronavirus symptoms in the last three days? SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is so easily spread that if you are in close contact with someone who has it, it's my job as a contact tracer to help make sure you stay home.Read Next:Minnesota National Guard Opened Fire on a Vehicle, Commander Says While some have called it a mistake for Marine leaders to set their sights on operations in one region of the world, Smith said the criticism is unfounded. Marines haven't forgotten their core missions, he said. They'll still carry out raids, disaster-relief missions and evacuations, he said, but they must be prepared to operate in areas where near-peer adversaries -- such as China or Russia -- also have influence.A woman in route to get her morning coffee was jolted awake with pounding on her front door she later discovered to be two alligators fighting in front of her home in Florida. The video of the surprising encounter in Fort Myers was posted on Facebook last week by Susan Geshel.

Leaked audio obtained by The Verge from a company meeting on Friday shows Zuckerberg saying the company might review its policies around the "discussion of state use of force." Zuckerberg justified leaving Trump's post untouched partially on the grounds that he referred to deploying the National Guard.Three days after George Floyd died with a Minneapolis police officer choking off his air, another black man writhed on the tarmac of a street in Paris as a police officer pressed a knee to his neck during an arrest. Immobilization techniques where officers apply pressure with their knees on prone suspects are used in policing around the world and have long drawn criticism. One reason why Floyd's death is sparking anger and touching nerves globally is that such techniques have been blamed for asphyxiations and other deaths in police custody beyond American shores, often involving non-white suspects.China's Huawei Technologies acted to cover up its relationship with a firm that had tried to sell prohibited U.S. computer gear to Iran, after Reuters in 2013 reported deep links between the firm and the telecom-equipment giant's chief financial officer, newly obtained internal Huawei documents show. Huawei has long described the firm - Skycom Tech Co Ltd - as a separate local business partner in Iran. Now, documents obtained by Reuters show how the Chinese tech titan effectively controlled Skycom.What's new: While early on COVID-19 was branded as a respiratory illness, its wide array of symptoms — from the toes to the brain — baffled experts. According to experts interviewed in an Elemental article, it's unprecedented that a respiratory illness could migrate outside the lungs. But new research suggests COVID-19 may actually be a blood vessel disease, which would explain all of the virus' symptoms.Troops deployments to the U.S. Central Command region will soon extend to yearlong, unaccompanied tours as the Defense Department continues to review how personnel are postured around the world, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday. Over the next two years, troops will see their tours in eight countries extend to 12 months: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Iraq. Troops families won't be allowed to accompany them on those tours, according to a memo announcing the change.To the editor: Generations of white Americans have been brainwashed to accept the axiom that municipal police officers must be protected from aggressive oversight. When our neighbors of color complained about unfair treatment at the hands of cops, not enough of us believed them. Sometimes peaceful is not enough': L.A. protesters explain why they hit the streets, May 31) But, with smartphones now routinely recording police-civilian interactions, it has become clear that these stories weren't just true, but actually commonplace.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday she could lift all social distancing measures to return the country to normal life, bar the international border closure, as early as next week. Ardern will decide on Monday whether the country is ready to shift to alert level 1, more than two months after she imposed a strict level 4 lockdown, shutting most businesses and forcing people to stay home, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Arden said waiting until Monday would allow her to see if recent changes, like the removal of restrictions on the number of people in bars and at social gatherings, had led to a rise in cases.Born in Branau, Austria, on April 20, 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to lead the Nazi Party in Germany during the 1920s and was appointed the nation's chancellor in 1933.

He was killed by people who had broken into Lee's Pawn & Jewelry, and his body found on the sidewalk at about 2:30 a.m.The two-metre rule on social distancing is based on outdated science that may have overestimated the risk by up to fifteen times, senior MPs and scientists have warned. The Government on Tuesday said the controversial rule would stay in place despite a major study showing the comparative risk of halving the distance to one metre was far less than previously thought. Business leaders and MPs have called for the guidance to be altered in line with WHO guidance and rules followed by some other countries in order to avoid mass redundancies and help the hospitality sector reopen.Chile has surpassed 100,000 cases of the coronavirus, the health minister said on Monday, as infections have spiraled in the capital Santiago, putting the South American nation´s healthcare system under "extraordinary" strain.

Judge Randolph D. Moss in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Americans wounded and killed in seven attacks carried out by Palestinians were eligible for damages from Iran and Syria because they provided “material support” to militant groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The court has not yet determined the amount of the damages.If you've been on Instagram on Tuesday morning, you may have seen a bunch of black squares in your main feed. The #BlackoutTuesday campaign was intended to push the music industry, which profits so much from black artists and gives them so little, to take a beat, get educated and reevaluate its positions. But the campaign quickly spread to non-music industry Joes and Janes, who woke up, saw some black boxes posted by their faves and friends, and reposted.Nelson Aguilar used to sell the rabbits that he raises on his Havana rooftop to restaurants. Now, with an ongoing pandemic, the 70-year-old uses them as currency, exchanging them for food or detergent to avoid multi-hour queues at poorly stocked shops. More Cubans are turning to bartering to meet their shopping needs, be it in person or on social media groups, as the novel coronavirus crisis worsens existing shortages of basic goods in the Communist-run island.Former Vice President Joe Biden urged Congress on Tuesday morning to pass legislation that would ban chokeholds, halt the transfer of military weapons to police departments, and create a “model” use-of-force standard for police across the country during a speech about racial injustice. Speaking in Philadelphia at City Hall, Biden addressed the nation the day after the stay-at-home order was lifted in Delaware, where he has been largely confined to his home studio. The Democratic nominee's speech came after cities erupted into fiery protests and clashes with police in the wake of George Floyd's death, with police in Washington, D.C., charging at peaceful protesters and throwing tear gas into the crowd near the White House.The precarious journey does not end for most parents with a healthy delivery; they return home to find constrained, unsettling options for child care as well. The pandemic has restricted visitors, including family members, who could provide critical relief to exhausted new parents, monitor for post-partum physical and mental health, and furnish food and comfort. Parents also struggle with the quandary of when they will feel comfortable sending their vulnerable new baby to child care so they can return to work.Sean Gallup/Getty Images As many in American cities began to protest police brutality and systemic racism, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a company town hall asked employees to come together and advocate for diverse voices. "We can model that behavior we need to see, coach others on how they can be better allies, and care for each other in times of crisis," Nadella said. Like most big tech companies, Microsoft has had only mixed success in making its employee ranks reflect the diversity of people in society and among its customers.More than 600 nurses worldwide are known to have died from COVID-19, which has infected an estimated 450,000 healthcare workers, the International Council of Nurses said on Wednesday. The death toll among nurses more than doubled in the past month from 260 on May 6, according to its figures, which are based on data from more than 30 countries. "In the last two months, we have seen the number of deaths of nurses as a result of coronavirus around the world rise from 100 to now in excess of 600 and we think worldwide the number of healthcare workers who could be infected by the virus is around 450,000," Howard Catton, chief executive officer of the Geneva-based ICN, told Reuters Television.Dating felt awkward, but I was tired of being single, so I looked at the month as a way of getting better at dating and maybe finding love along the way. Dating became a numbers game to me, and I learned how important it was to put yourself out there often and not only go on one date a month. While I didn't meet anyone I was interested in dating during the 14 dates that month, I ended up going on an extra date (date 15), and that's when the magic happened.Sri Lanka's Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to consider petitions filed by opposition parties and civil groups seeking to annul a presidential order dissolving Parliament because the coronavirus pandemic has prevented elections within the constitutionally mandated time. The Supreme Court made the decision after listening to arguments from the petitioners and the government. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved Parliament on March 2.Before a single case of COVID-19 had been reported in his state, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine began imposing sweeping restrictions. The moves may have seemed radical at the time, but as Ohio now begins to gradually reopen, having recorded just under 2,000 deaths so far, public health experts say the governor's swift actions likely helped the state avoid the fate of its northern neighbor, Michigan, or that of many East Coast hot spots. At a time when responses to the virus seem increasingly marked by partisanship, Governor DeWine's apolitical, fact-based approach has earned him plaudits from the media and sky-high approval ratings from voters on both sides of the aisle.The men of Lieutenant Edwin K. Smith's antitank platoon, 2nd Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division peered over the gun shields of their 37mm cannon at the column of Vichy French armored cars approaching their roadblock. The platoon had been ordered to man a roadblock near the town of El Ancor, protecting the flank of the 26th Regiment during its landing as part of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa. The question was soon answered when a burst of machine-gun fire stuttered from one of the armored cars.African, Cuban and Haitian migrants stranded in Honduras after borders were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic began trekking northward on Tuesday in an attempt to reach the United States, migration authorities said.

Lizandro Vallecillo, a spokesman for the national migration institute, said he counted 50 people from television images.A bishop criticized President Trump for making an appearance in front of the historic St. John's Episcopal Church, without even stopping to pray. Mr. Trump held a Bible and took photos outside the church Monday after authorities used tear gas to clear the yard of protesters. Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, who oversees the church and the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., told "CBS This Morning" on Tuesday that she wasn't informed in advance that the president would visit.Looting and vandalism in cities across the country have dealt another blow to small businesses that were already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak. Along with big chain stores like Target, Walgreen and Macy's, independent retailers in neighborhoods and downtown sections were targets of vandals and looters who struck as police mobilized to contain large demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Many businesses had been closed by state and local government orders as officials tried to contain the spread of the coronavirus, leaving owners with little or no revenue since March.This week, Amazon warehouse workers lost a $2 pay bump brought in to reward them for coming in during the coronavirus pandemic. Amazon has now phased out two major policies brought in to protect workers, the other being that they could take unlimited amounts of unpaid time off without being penalized. The apparent return to normality is at odds with the experiences of warehouse workers who told Business Insider they still felt in danger coming to work.Vietnam's most gravely-ill COVID-19 patient, a British pilot who works for its national airline, has started to recover from the illness and may no longer require a lung transplant, state media said on Wednesday. Vietnam, which has reported no deaths from the coronavirus, has mounted an all-out effort to save the 43-year-old man, who has been identified officially by the government as "Patient 91". Until recently, the Vietnam Airlines pilot was thought by doctors and officials to be in urgent need of a lung transplant.Jamie Davis Smith, a mother of four, understood the Stauffers' struggle, since her oldest daughter, Claire, has intellectual and physical disabilities. Over the years, Davis Smith considered finding an alternative living option for Claire, but could never go through with it. When Myka Stauffer told her more than 700,000 fans that she and her husband had "rehomed" their adopted son, Huxley, who has autism, those who had loyally followed the family's journey to China and back, and even donated to the cause, were understandably upset.Governor JB Pritzker, Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle and Cardinal Blase Cupich to discuss the unrest across the Chicago area and the nation.Former CIA operative Valerie Plame has lost her race in the Democratic primary for an open seat representing New Mexico in Congress. In her first run for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as a former U.S. intelligence operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion.A prolonged U.S. air campaign would be a difficult proposition. Unlike past campaigns against Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, and Afghanistan, Washington would find regional allies who could provide air bases a difficult proposition. Pakistan enjoys warm relations with most of the Sunni states, particularly the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, both of whom have air bases capable of hosting U.S. tactical aircraft, as well as Saudi Arabia and Oman.A study of Dutch blood donors has found that around 5.5% of them have developed antibodies against the new coronavirus, blood donation firm Sanquin said on Wednesday. The study, conducted among 7,000 donors between May 10 and 20, gives an indication of what percentage of the Dutch population may have already had the disease. A similar study in April showed antibodies in 3% of Dutch blood donors.President Donald Trump appeared to tell the first lady, Melania Trump, to smile, during a visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine, a day after his visit to the St John's Episcopal Church outraged religious leaders. In footage taken of the visit to the shrine on Tuesday, the president was filmed briefly saying something to Ms Trump, before smiling for the photographers, who were documenting their visit. He then seemed to notice that she was not smiling, and spoke to her again before Ms Trump then forced a quick smile and walked away with her husband.The activity inside the Santa Monica location of Sunnin felt urgent on Monday morning. Community volunteers, in their protective masks, had spread out through the restaurant's dining room: They picked up shards of broken planters and swept spilled soil, righted turned-over furniture and stacked it against the wall, scrubbed sky-blue paint from toppled cans off the concrete floor. Several of them worked to nail plywood over the shattered window where pillagers had entered the day before.Built in the late 1880s as a rural spa village, the northwest Arkansas hamlet is defined by painstakingly preserved Victorian buildings and narrow cobblestone streets that snake through its perpetually bustling entertainment district. Just as European settlers traveled to Eureka Springs for the promise of the healing waters of the Ozark mountains, hundreds of tourists crowd its narrow sidewalks on the weekends, brushing past each other to buy handmade jewelry at the Ladybug Emporium or a cup of coffee at Local Flavor Café. Historically, its busy walkways were part of Eureka Springs' unique charm.Germany will outlaw the 'morphing' of passport photos, in which pictures of two people are digitally combined, making it possible to assign multiple identities to a single document. Morphing can trick artificial intelligence used at passport control into 'recognising' different individuals. The government on Wednesday backed a law requiring people to either have their photo taken at a passport office or, if they use a photographer, have it submitted in digital form over a secure connection, spokesman Steffen Seibert said.Sugar Shutterstock Scientists now know that eating too much sweet stuff can not only lead to diabetes but actively damage your cells and increase your risk of developing cancer. But that's not all. New research suggests that sugar may fuel tumor growth in the body because cancer loves to use sugar as fuel.Before Kylie Jenner had even turned 18, or launched her Kylie Cosmetics line in 2015, she owned an impressive starter home in Calabasas. This is a substantial amount more than the $2.7 million Jenner paid for it, and markedly more than the $3.15 million she sold it for in 2017. Set on a 0.364-acre lot, the home comprises five bedrooms and six bathrooms spread across 4,851 square feet, with an optional sixth bedroom that Jenner converted into a glam room complete with mirrored walls, lighted vanity, and custom drawers.The challengers argued that King's loss of clout, even more than his continuous string of provocative and racially-charged statements, was reason enough for turning on him.
